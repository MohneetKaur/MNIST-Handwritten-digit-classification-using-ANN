# MNIST-Handwritten-digit-classification-using-ANN

This project is a handwritten digit classification application using a deep learning model. It is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it can accurately recognize handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The model is trained on the popular MNIST dataset, which consists of a large collection of labeled handwritten digit images.

The application allows users to upload their own handwritten digit images and receive predictions on the digit represented in the image. It provides a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications. The uploaded image is preprocessed, resized, and normalized before being fed into the trained model for prediction.

The project showcases the implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for image classification tasks and demonstrates the practical application of deep learning in the field of computer vision. It serves as a beginner-friendly example for those interested in learning about image classification and exploring the use of deep learning for real-world applications.

The code, documentation, and trained model are provided in the GitHub repository, enabling users to understand the implementation details, experiment with the code, and contribute to the project's development.
